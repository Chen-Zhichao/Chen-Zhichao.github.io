Welcome to my personal website! I am Zhichao Chen (陈治潮), a third-year PhD student at UCLA NanoCAD Lab, advised by Prof. Puneet Gupta. My research focuses on system technology co-optimization (STCO) and advanced packaging. Currently I am working on developing a yield modeling framework for hybrid bonding technology.
