Hello, I am Zhichao Chen (陈治潮), a third-year Ph.D. student at [NanoCAD Lab](https://nanocad.ee.ucla.edu/), [University of California, Los Angeles](https://www.ee.ucla.edu/), advised by Prof. [Puneet Gupta](https://samueli.ucla.edu/people/puneet-gupta/). 
Prior to that, I received my B.E. degree from [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/), where I worked with Prof. Li Du at [ISCL](https://iscl.nju.edu.cn/).  
My current research focuses on system technology co-optimization (STCO) and advanced packaging. Currently I am working on developing a yield modeling framework for hybrid bonding technology.

I am always open to research collaborations and internship opportunities. Please feel free to reach out if you are interested in working with me.
