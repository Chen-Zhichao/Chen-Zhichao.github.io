## About Me
Welcome to my personal website! I am Zhichao Chen (陈治潮), a third-year Ph.D. student at [NanoCAD Lab](https://nanocad.ee.ucla.edu/), [UCLA](https://www.ucla.edu), advised by Prof. Puneet Gupta. My research focuses on system technology co-optimization (STCO) and advanced packaging. Currently I am working on developing a yield modeling framework for hybrid bonding technology.
